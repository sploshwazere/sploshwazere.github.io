<ol>Because they have so many predators mice usually only live for about six months in the wild.</ol>
<p>
<ol>Mice and rats are the most commonly used animals in laboratories for scientific experiments.</ol>
<p>
<ol>A mouse eats from 15 to 20 times a day. Therefore they usually build their homes close to food sources, tending to only travel up to 8 m from their burrows to find food.</ol>
<p>
<ol>Mice tails can grow as long as their bodies.</ol>
<p>
<ol>Mice are usually nocturnal animals. They have poor eyesight but make up for this with their very good hearing and smell.</ol>
